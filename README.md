# RL-Structure

Reinforcement learning for frame structure shape generation using reinforcement learning.
These programs are extended part of my master thesis from Graduate School of Engineering, Tokai Univ. Japan 2019-2021.

In this research, we train muitiple tpye of reinforcement learning agent (Q-Learning, Actor-Critic, DDPG, MADDGP) for \

1. frame structural shape generation to minimize strain energy. \
2. minimal surface generation to minimize the domain surface area. \

After some training agents will be able to perform these tasks. \

I make this program for my juniors to do their research using google-colab. \
