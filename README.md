# RL-Structure

Reinforcement learning for frame structure shape generation using reinforcement learning.
These programs are extended part of my master thesis from Graduate School of Engineering, Tokai Univ. Japan 2019-2021.

In this research, we train muitiple tpye of reinforcement learning agent (Q-Learning, Actor-Critic, DDPG, MADDGP) for 

1. frame structural shape generation to minimize strain energy 
2. minimal surface generation to minimize the domain surface area.

After some training agents will be able to perform these tasks.

I make this program for my juniors to do their research using google-colab.
